**Africa Dollar - An Algorithmic Stablecoin with Yield Farming**

**Business Case**

A very big issue with cryptocurrencies being used as a method of trade is the inherent volatility that goes with it. Algorithmic stablecoins were designed to eleminate this price volatilty and balance the circulating supply being pegged to a reserve asset like the USD, gold or any other asset.

African countries in general are at a disadvantage as many things are pegged to the USD and local currencies are very weak against the USD leading to highly priced goods and services.

The aim of the Africa Dollar is to create a currency that can equal the playing field for African countries through the use of a algorithmic stable coin that eliminates the volatility inherently found in cryptocurrencies.

This is done through controlling the circulating supply by use of a algorithm that manipulates the Supply and Demand equation from traditional economics. In traditional economics the price is determined by supply and demand, meaning if demand is higher than supply price will increase and when the supply is higher than demand the price will decrease. The algorithm contained in Africa Dollar will keep the price stable by increasing the suplly when demand is high and decreasing the supply when deamand is low which will lead to a stable price.
